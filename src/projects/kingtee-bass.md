In my role as both art director and graphic designer, I curated the visual world for King Tee's album "Thy Kingdom Come", embodied as the vinyl, cassette, and CD artworks.
The album features a star-studded cast, including the renowned Dr. Dre, Ice-T, and Shaquille O'Neal, with Dr. Dre taking charge as producer and mixer.

The vinyl features a matte black finish on thick paper. The title shines in black glossy UV spot color, creating a captivating play with light. When opening the gatefold, we're met with large full bleed photos of King Tee from back in the day, overlayed by the tracklist and lyrics. 

The CD artwork keeps the same front, while the disc was printed with an unconventional inversion. The transparent tape cassette has a white pad print on it, taking cues from the hiphop 90's.

The album was released in 2023 on the Swedish record label RMV Grammofon AB.
