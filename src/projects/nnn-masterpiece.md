To build a lead up to the album, I art directed and designed the world of 'Undertones' and carefully explored the sonic world of NONONO to create a seamless audiovisual experience.

The logotype, an intertwined symbol of the letters NNN became the central point and by crafting a massive neon-statue and placing it in different locations in Sweden we had created the visual heartbeat of the album. We got to showcase their Swedish roots, the vibrancy in the beats and unique voice of the singer.

For the first single we went beyond digital and created a limited edition single sleeve vinyl to manifest the soul of the music. 
The white and innocent vinyl record met with rough, distorted black and white design pieces for the labels.

A bold start to the 'Undertones' journey to make the album the masterpiece it went to evolve to.

The single Masterpiece was released in September 2017 on the record label Warner Music Sweden AB.
