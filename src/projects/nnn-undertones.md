I art directed and designed the world of 'Undertones' and carefully explored the sonic world of NONONO to create a seamless audiovisual experience.

The logotype, an intertwined symbol of the letters NNN became the central point and by crafting a massive neon-statue and placing it in different locations in Sweden we had created the visual heartbeat of the album. We got to showcase their Swedish roots, the vibrancy in the beats and unique voice of the singer.

For the first single we went beyond digital and created a limited edition single sleeve vinyl to manifest the soul of the music. 
The white and innocent vinyl record met with rough, distorted black and white design pieces for the labels.

We created artworks for the 4 singles leading up to the album release.

"Ego" Digital release: 2018. "Friends" Digital release: 2018. "Lost Song" Digital release: 2017. "Masterpiece" Digital release: 2017, Vinyl: 2017.

This was followed up by the digital and vinyl release of the bands second studio album. Engraved on green vinyl.

The album Undertones was released in September 2018 on the record label Warner Music Sweden AB.
